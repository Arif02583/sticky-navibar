            PATIENT

        <p class="text"> Stranger,
            I know it's hard to see right now, the big picture of your life. I
            know that it seems frightening or overwhelming not to know
            how your life will turn out in the end. But if we all knew how
            our lives would end up, it would take all the joy and delight
            out of life. It would strip life of all its wonders and surprises.
            The Universe is the divine intelligence that makes your heart
            beat and can hear your every thought. The Universe is aware
            of you and interacts with you regularly even if you might
            not have noticed it before. The Universe knows when it is
            the right time to bring people and opportunity into your life
            but so often us humans are not patient enough to wait for
            that divine timing. We worry that the Universe has forgotten
            about us or can't hear us when, instead, the Universe is simply
            waiting for the perfect time.
            I hear you thinking
            "why is this happening to me. The times
            have been hard and it feels like you're walking down a dark
            tunnel with no end in sight. Things keep moving in the
            shadows or threatening to jump out of the darkness and sen
            you running back in the direction you came from. Many times</p>
